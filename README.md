# Speech Synthesis Project

This project aims to build an advanced speech synthesis model and a voice cloner, inspired by state-of-the-art LLM-based TTS systems.

## Structure
- `src/` - Main source code for training, inference, and utilities
- `models/` - Pretrained and custom model checkpoints
- `data/` - Datasets for training and evaluation
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for experiments and prototyping

## Goals
- High-quality text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis
- Voice cloning from short audio samples
- Modular, extensible codebase

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Explore the `notebooks/` for demos
3. Use `src/train.py` to train models
4. Use `src/infer.py` for inference and voice cloning
